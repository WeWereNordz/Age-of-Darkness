 sol_dialogue_text_1:0 "§OA dark fog seeps into the throne room, slowly covering the floor in a layer of black smoke. The windows begin to cloud as the fog dominates the room.§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_2:0 "§S“Is the ritual a success? Have I summoned Nija?!” §!"
 sol_dialogue_text_3:0 "§O“I go by many names, young Casimir. What Mithrasian tongue-name you give me is irrlevant. What is important is that I have answered your call.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_4:0 "§S“O' Devil, I have presented you with a blood sacrifice to ask of you a wish.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_5:0 "§O“I am listening, mortal. What desire would you want me to fulfill today? Riches beyond your wildest dreams? Irrestible to women? Pique my interests, young Prince.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_6:0 "§S“If that were true, you would have released me already! The Celestia I knew would never have kept me here against my will!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_7:0 "§S“She was kind. She was loving. And I miss her so much.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_8:0 "§S“But you are none of those things!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_9:0 "§O“I am more than she ever was! Celestia stood by and watched as ponies suffered because of her weakness. She could not keep you safe from the Changelings. She could not stop Sombra or Tirek. But I can!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_10:0 "§S“By becoming just as bad as they were?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_11:0 "§O“Sometimes ponies need more than just suggestions to protect themselves. If I have to sacrifice some liberties for the sake of keeping my beloved children safe, then so be it. I will not apologise for doing what is necessary.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_12:0 "§S“If you cannot convince ponies you are right without force, then you were never right in the first place.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_13:0 "§O“I think you underestimate how stubborn they can be.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_14:0 "§S“...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_15:0 "§O“That is all for now. You may go back to your room.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_16:0 "§S“Excuse me?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_17:0 "§O“I have always been proud of you, Twilight Sparkle. But even you cannot comprehend what it's like to rule for millennia, constantly offering kindness and peace only for the world to take advantage of you and your beloved subjects at every opportunity.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_18:0 "§O“I have seen more dynasties rise and fall than you could even begin to imagine. Some were allies. Most were enemies. And not a single one has ever stayed a true friend to ponykind. I have seen my dreams of a peaceful and happy world crumble to dust so many times I’ve grown accustomed to the pain. Despite this, I still hoped that one day, friendship would triumph.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_19:0 "§O“But that hope has worn thin.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_20:0 "§S“I...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_21:0 "§S“I had no idea you felt that way.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_22:0 "§S“But you can’t just give up on friendship, even if sometimes it can be hard to believe in. Life isn’t worth living without friendship. You’re the one who taught me that.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_23:0 "§O“When you are a ruler, you learn that the safety of your subjects is more important than your own happiness.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_24:0 "§O“I don’t think I’ve had a true friend in centuries.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_25:0 "§O“But that’s fine, because I will always have my little ponies.” §!"
 sol_dialogue_text_26:0 "§O“And I refuse to see them suffer and die from yet another betrayal at the claws of our so-called ‘allies’.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_27:0 "§S“Well I happen to have friends all across the world. And they would never betray me!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_28:0 "§O“Oh yeah? Where were they when Equestria was attacked by our enemies?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_29:0 "§O“Where are they now, when you are here as my prisoner?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_30:0 "§O“You’ve been here for months, Twilight. And I can assure you, there has not been one attempt made by your so-called ‘friends’ to rescue you.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_31:0 "§O“They don’t care about us. I’ve seen ponykind suffer under foreign invaders enough times to learn that friendship lesson. If the rest of the world is unwilling to accept my benevolence, then I don’t see the point in continuing this pointless charade.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_32:0 "§O“Perhaps the coming years will teach them the error of their ways, but by then it will be too little too late. I’m done being merciful. Let them suffer the consequences of their actions.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_33:0 "§S“I don’t know what to say...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_34:0 "§O“I know. It’s hard to accept that we can only trust each other. But if we don’t, we only leave ourselves open to being exploited.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_35:0 "§O“...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_36:0 "§O“I’ll leave you to think about what I’ve said.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_37:0 "§O“Good morning, Twilight. Have you thought about what I’ve said?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_38:0 "§S“I have. And I think you’re wrong.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_39:0 "§O“Oh?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_40:0 "§S“Friendship doesn’t make ponykind unable to face our enemies. Rather, it is the force that makes us stronger. It’s not fear or hatred that gives our soldiers the will to fight. It’s the drive to protect their friends and family.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_41:0 "§O“I am not opposed to friendship between Equestrians, Twilight. It is the other nations I cannot trust.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_42:0 "§S“I’m sure the ancient tribes once said the same thing about each other.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_43:0 "§O“It took frost demons and the threat of extinction to bring those nations together. And even then it was only my arrival that prevented this fragile alliance from shattering.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_44:0 "§S“Friendship may be difficult, but it will only make us stronger. Were it not for my friends, I would never have been able to stop Nightmare Moon, Discord or Tirek.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_45:0 "§O“Had he not, Tirek would have been defeated easily. Count yourself lucky Tirek was only after our magic. I could list a dozen villains who would do far worse.” §!"
 sol_dialogue_text_46:0 "§S“That’s a very cynical way of looking at what happened.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_47:0 "§S“Don’t forget, I could only defeat Tirek because I forgave Discord.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_48:0 "§O“But had we not trusted him in the first place, you would never have needed to forgive Discord. Had I shattered his statue, he would have never escaped. Had I killed Nightmare Moon instead of banishing her, she would have never returned.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_49:0 "§S“But you would also never have a sister and a reformed spirit of chaos to support you. By showing them both forgiveness, you strengthened Equestria.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_50:0 "§O“I think we’re done here.” §!"
 sol_dialogue_text_51:0 "§O“Please, Twilight. Did you really think it was a coincidence that I sent you to Ponyville the day before my sister was due to return with a list of ponies who just so happened to be the future Element Bearers?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_52:0 "§S“...what?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_53:0 "§O“Do you have any idea how much planning it took to get you six together? Who do you think pulled the strings to give a flight school dropout with nothing to her name a job leading the Ponyville weather team? Who do you think suggested a flightless pegasus with no official qualifications be put in charge of caring for the Everfree Forest? Who do you think gave Applejack’s family land to settle that just so happened to be right next to the Tree of Harmony?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_54:0 "§O“ME!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_55:0 "§S“Y-You... No! This can’t be true!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_56:0 "§O“Oh, but it is.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_57:0 "§O“Don’t get me wrong, your friendship is real. But it would not exist without my effort.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_58:0 "§O“I honestly thought you would’ve confronted me after I singled out Fluttershy as the pony who could reform the ancient spirit who once terrorised ponykind for centuries. Or when you realised that I gave you an alicorn babysitter before you had even gotten your cutie mark.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_59:0 "§S“But how? How could you have possibly known this?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_60:0 "§O“When you are as old as I am, you start to see patterns in everything.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_61:0 "§O“There was a time when I thought my vision was absolute. I would use this power to perpetuate ponykind’s utopia, laying plans centuries in advance. I suffered humiliation after humiliation so that you could grow, all leading up to the moment of your ascension. A moment I had predicted decades before you were born.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_62:0 "§O“But in my arrogance, I allowed my vision to be clouded. Stalliongrad should have done away with my delusions of control. But I convinced myself the stress of planning my sister’s return had caused me to overlook the evil festering in my own nation.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_63:0 "§O“I even chose to ignore the darkness that lurked in the hearts of our enemies even as they plotted our downfall. I’ve seen ponykind be wiped out in a thousand different ways and ignored each one because I had faith that friendship could persevere in even the most monstrous of creatures.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_64:0 "§O“But that’s in the past now. I will not make the same mistake again.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_65:0 "§O“I want you to consider my words before our next meeting. Can you do that for me?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_66:0 "§S“...okay...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_67:0 "§O“Excellent. Until next time, my faithful student.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_68:0 "§O“This tea is delightful. Wouldn’t you agree, Twilight?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_69:0 "§O“You’re awfully quiet today. Is something wrong?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_70:0 "§S“Why am I here?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_71:0 "§O“Because I captured you, of course.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_72:0 "§S“But why not just kill me? Surely you see me as a threat? If I escaped, I could use the elements against you.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_73:0 "§O“Oh Twilight, you still see me as another version of Nightmare Moon. But we are nothing alike. Luna’s transformation was the result of petty jealousy. Mine was through an all-consuming need to protect my children.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_74:0 "§S“By killing any of your ‘children’ who defy you?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_75:0 "§O“I will not deny that I have caused them pain.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_76:0 "§O“When it comes to leading a nation, you have to accept that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_77:0 "§O“And that is why you’re here, because ponykind needs you, if only to temper the worst of my excesses.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_78:0 "§S“If you really cared about ponies, you would let them make their own choices and not kill those who disagree with you.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_79:0 "§O“DON’T YOU DARE QUESTION MY LOVE FOR THEM!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_80:0 "§O“Ahem...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_81:0 "§O“In your current state, you would only disrupt the careful order I have created. Rest assured, you will be released eventually. But not before I give you a few very valuable lessons.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_82:0 "§SSo that’s it. You’re hoping I will betray my friends?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_83:0 "§O“No. I’m hoping you will use everything I have taught you to help me save them. Unfortunately, your cooperation is mandatory. You are too valuable to Equestria for me to give you freedom.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_84:0 "§O“I wish it didn’t have to be this way. You are the closest thing I’ve ever had to a daughter. But I can’t allow sentiment to cloud my judgement again.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_85:0 "§O“One way or another, you will serve the new order. You must make a decision. Please, choose the right one. If you refuse, I will be forced to take action.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_86:0 "§S“Enough with your threats! I will never turn my back on my friends and everything I believe in just to help you perpetuate this oppressive empire!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_87:0 "§O“Admit it. You’re starting to doubt yourself. I can see it in your eyes.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_88:0 "§S“No! I won’t let you trick me! As soon as my friends come to rescue me, I will join them in defeating you. The friendship we share is stronger than anything else in the world!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_89:0 "§S“You taught me that, a long time ago.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_90:0 "§S“I know you’re still in there, Celestia. And I promise you, I haven’t given up yet.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_91:0 "§O“Save your breath. You’re not the first one to give me this spiel.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_92:0 "§S“No. You need to hear this. You need to know that we still love you and it’s not too late to turn back.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_93:0 "§O“Who says I want to turn back?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_94:0 "§S“I know you do, deep down inside. The Celestia I knew would never condone the evil you’ve committed.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_95:0 "§O“Evil? That’s a bit harsh.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_96:0 "§S“How else would you describe your actions?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_97:0 "§S“Necessary? How could what you’re doing possibly be necessary?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_98:0 "§O“Ponykind is caught in a web of delusions and lies. They are unwilling to take the steps necessary to save themselves from certain destruction.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_99:0 "§O“I don’t take pleasure in what I must do. But I have no choice.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_100:0 "§O“I love my ponies too much to watch them die.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_101:0 "§S“But how do you know harmony would lead to our destruction when it has brought us so much peace and happiness?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_102:0 "§O“Please, just look at the state of the world.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_103:0 "§O“In Griffonia, we are hated and exploited despite all that we have done for the continent.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_104:0 "§O“Some griffon nations have even taken to butchering entire pony families and towns simply because we had the audacity to exist!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_105:0 "§O“Even our so-called ‘allies’ only work with us out of selfishness. Think about all the threats Equestria has faced. They did not lift so much as a hoof to help us.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_106:0 "§O“But now that I sit on the throne, the harmonist rebels have been flooded with foreign aid. They are fine with letting Tirek siphon us of magic, but not me subjecting their actions to a little scrutiny?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_107:0 "§O“They could not be any more obvious.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_108:0 "§O“So with the world united against us, surely you can see that ponies need somepony to guide them in the right direction?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_109:0 "§S“I... I suppose.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_110:0 "§S“But that doesn’t excuse what you’re doing to Equestria.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_111:0 "§O“Of course it doesn’t. But I will not stop just so ponykind can be subjected to an even worse fate.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_112:0 "§O“What I do is harsh. But it is necessary.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_113:0 "§O“Believe me, I wish ponykind could live in peace.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_114:0 "§O“They deserve all the happiness the world has to offer.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_115:0 "§O“But I don’t have that luxury. They may not be happy under my rule. But they will be safe. That’s all I want.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_116:0 "§O“I can tell that this information has disturbed you.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_117:0 "§S“No, I’m fine!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_118:0 "§O“You forget that I practically raised you, Twilight. I know when you’re upset.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_119:0 "§O“It’s okay, Twilight. It can be hard to accept that some actions, though cruel, are ultimately necessary. Go, get some rest.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_120:0 "§S“Justice? How could any of the atrocities you’ve committed possibly be justice!?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_121:0 "§O“At best, a dissenter is unknowingly putting ponykind’s existence at stake by preventing me from doing my job. At worst, they’re working with foreign powers to undermine the greatest hope our species has had in thousands of years.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_122:0 "§O“I only ask that ponies do what I know will give them the best chance of survival. Those that try to stop me are putting countless lives at risk with their actions.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_123:0 "§S“How does forcing us to obey you under threat of death improve our chances of survival?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_124:0 "§O“Because if not for me, something worse would only exploit our weakness.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_125:0 "§O“We are surrounded by enemies, Twilight. They would not hesitate to crush us just because we dared to take our rightful place under the sun. They above all deserve the justice I will bring upon them.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_126:0 "§S“But that doesn’t excuse what you’re doing to Equestria.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_127:0 "§S“I’m not naive enough to believe that there aren’t creatures out there who would and probably have killed ponies without a shred of remorse. But there’s nothing just about killing innocents simply because they belong to one particular species.” §!"
 sol_dialogue_text_128:0 "§O“If those so-called ‘innocents’ were as pure as you described them, they would have tried to stop their countrymen from killing us.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_129:0 "§S“So you think death is the appropriate punishment for cowardice?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_130:0 "§O“When it leads to the death of my children, yes.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_131:0 "§S“Then you clearly don’t understand the value of life.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_132:0 "§O“You test my patience, Twilight. Leave.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_133:0 "§O“So, have you reconsidered my offer?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_134:0 "§S“I still won’t join you. Not after everything you’ve done.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_135:0 "§O“And why not? Do you truly see me as some sort of irredeemable monster?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_136:0 "§S“Well, no...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_137:0 "§S“But that doesn’t change the fact that what you’ve done to Equestria is wrong.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_138:0 "§S“Yes, because in doing so you’ve become just as bad as they are.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_139:0 "§O“You cannot defeat an enemy by pulling your punches. Peace and friendship does not beat order and aggression. At least my way gives us a fighting chance.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_140:0 "§S“But what’s the point in fighting a tyrant if you become just as bad to secure victory?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_141:0 "§O“I hardly think I’m worse than Chrysalis or Sombra.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_142:0 "§S“Then consider my question a hypothetical.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_143:0 "§O“Survival would be my reason.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_144:0 "§O“If I was an ordinary pony forced to decide between supporting myself and a griffon or changeling tyrant, I would pick myself simply because I would rather be the oppressor instead of the oppressed.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_145:0 "§S“That hardly sounds fair.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_146:0 "§O“It isn’t. But in this world, it’s kill or be killed. If you had to kill to save your friends, you would.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_147:0 "§S“But you don’t even seem interested in looking for a third option.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_148:0 "§O“I’ve searched for that third option for a thousand years. I’m sick of looking.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_149:0 "§S“Then you just aren’t looking hard enough. There is good in every creature.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_150:0 "§O“Your optimism is nauseating.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_151:0 "§S“Perhaps. But I have yet to meet a creature of pure evil.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_152:0 "§O“They don’t have to be pure evil to destroy everything you’ve ever loved.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_153:0 "§S“But only a creature of pure evil can ever be beyond reasoning or friendship.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_154:0 "§O“I should warn you, tomorrow you will have to make a final decision. For the sake of Equestria, I hope you make the right one.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_155:0 "§O“Until we meet again, Twilight.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_156:0 "§O“Whether you like it or not, millions of ponies out there cheer my name. I know you have seen it. They want me. They fear what I might be, but they crave the order and stability that I promise. And they will fight for that promise.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_157:0 "§O“If you would break me, maybe even seal me in the Sun, what then? What do you plan to do with the countless millions who believe in me?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_158:0 "§O“Will you break them as well? Will you strike down pony after pony whose only crime was believing in me? Will you create orphans out of fillies, destroy loving families and leave countless lovers to weep, just because they wanted a brighter future for Equestria?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_159:0 "§O“Of course, you will be surrounded by ponies telling you it was the right thing to do. But in reality, they will hate you for stealing their future. For letting yet another civil war engulf Equestria.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_160:0 "§O“I've seen it, Twilight. Death and suffering on a scale this nation could not even begin to imagine. What I saw horrifies even me.” §!"
 sol_dialogue_text_161:0 "§S“I... I...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_162:0 "§O“But it doesn’t have to be that way.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_163:0 "§O“You can choose to join me.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_164:0 "§O“Together, we can bring a new age for ponykind. One where they will be free from all threats, living in eternal peace and prosperity!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_165:0 "§O“Twilight... if you truly believe in what I once taught you, then help me to once again save Equestria from calamity.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_166:0 "§S“Daybreaker... I...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_167:0 "§O“It’s okay, Twilight. Tomorrow, I will summon you here. You can give me your answer then. I beg you, please make the right one.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_168:0 "§O“So, have you come to a decision?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_169:0 "§S“Yes, I have. I...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_170:0 "§S“I will join you.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_171:0 "§O“Oh Twilight, you don’t know how much it pleases me to hear that! I knew I could count on you, my eternally faithful student! I promise you, together we will create a brighter future for our nation!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_172:0 "§S“Of course, your highness.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_173:0 "§O“Please, you may call me Daybreaker. I was not lying when I said I see you as the daughter I never had.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_174:0 "§S“That... that means a lot to me.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_175:0 "§S“Thank you, Daybreaker.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_176:0 "§O"Today is a day of new beginnings. The sun is rising, the future is within our grasp. Equestria is being reborn. And you will be reborn with it.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_177:0 "§O“Now rise and take your place at my side, Twilight Sparkle.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_178:0 "§S“Yes, I have.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_179:0 "§S“I refuse to be your tool.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_180:0 "§S“Celestia was like a mother to me. She was always there, guiding me towards true friendship. I know that if she was here, she would be telling me to refuse your ‘offer’.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_181:0 "§S“But I’m not just refusing for her sake. I’m refusing for the sake of my friends and all the ponies you brutalise under the guise of ‘protection’.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_182:0 "§S“Celestia might be gone. But I know that one day, she will return. Because I’m never going to give up on freeing her. No matter how long you keep me here, I will never bend to you!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_183:0 "§O“How touching. Once more, I am plagued by the legacy of my past delusions.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_184:0 "§O“But you are missing one crucial piece of information, Twilight.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_185:0 "§O“You never had a choice.”§!"
