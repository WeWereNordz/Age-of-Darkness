 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Age of Darkness"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Has Mithras ever known peace?"
 BOT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Botrelia, lead by Johan Zuiani is the rising power in a world of uncertainty. Wracked by hedonism and debauchery on a national scale, this unholy nation now looks outwards to its neighbors, to expand its western border. The ability to hold onto that border remains to be seen."
 EVO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After coming out of a bloody continent-spanning civil war, the nation of Evolia emerges into the new era united under the populist banner of Chancellor Franz Wolf. The people of Evolia are determined to march towards its destined greatness and their deserved spot in the sun. Through a lengthy period of reconstruction, the country prepares itself to resist the aggressive eastern hegemony that is slowly overtaking the world."
 LEG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once little more than a squabbling land of warring states, the Federal Monarchy of Legatia suffers from a factionalized government, with seperate houses seeking control over the state. With enemies on all sides, and a populace still not entirely unified, King Legitius must struggle to navigate these trying times, and bring glory to Legatia - no matter the cost."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Pithian Administration is the oldest empire in Mithras. Now the sick-man of the world, the current monarchy faces trouble in keeping their wide empire of conflicting languages, culture, and religions together. To make matters worse, this secretive hermit empire is rife with internal conflict, as betrayal begins to rear it's head in the ranks of the Pithian Court, as well as the supernatural."
 EUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The recently independent nation of Eurada has distanced itself from it's former lord, King Legitius I. Led by a democratic government headed by Sylvia Mitra, Eurada must began it's life wary of countries near and far, with enemies lurking just beyond the coast far greater than they have faced before."
 PES_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The people of Pestfriland are a hearty folk. Known to revere the atom, this people lead by the Bloody Baron have shown to have greater prospects in mind than their small island historially plagued by disease and a low standard of life. Left crippled by the former aristocracy's incompetence with all matters government, only through strong leadership and a mobilization of the people will the Baron's dreams of world domination become a reality."
 REG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the political reforms of the past decade, Regia stands idle. The wheels of government rarely turn in this hermit state and as a result, has faded into obsecurity."
 DES_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Desunion had always kept to itself. Limiting their trading and influence from other nations to only those on it's island, Desunion was rudely awoken to the politics, issues, and struggles of the world when it was visited by Eirian ships and diplomats. Twenty years later, Desunion believes it has surpassed her neighbors in terms of military superiority. Will now be the time to test these theories?"
 EIR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The island of Eirie has been one of political strife, nationalism, and bloodshed. In the past decade, the former Pestfriland colony has quickly formed their own ideals, splitting into democratic, communistic, and fascist governments across the island. While the people of Eirie are unsure of what may come next, the leaders of this new disjointed island have only unity and supremacy on their minds."
